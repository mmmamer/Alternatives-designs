        <p class="p-graph">This new and original concept, in house designed and manufactured SRC Generator Technology balances against its own power source. When used with DC Batteries the SRC Generator balances against the batteries maintaining them in a state of full charge during use. Whilst supplying a lesser excess power for use in power requirements.</p>

        <p>This technology does not break any rules of Physics. It applies them with both lateral and alternative thoughts and application.</p>
        <b><p>The SRC Generator Technology is <u>NOT</u> Perpetual Motion</p></b>
        <b><p>The SRC Generator Technology is <u>NOT</u> free Energy, it uses energy to create energy.</p></b>
        <p>Friction will as with all machinery eventually Kill it.</p>

        <p>Earlier variants of the present unit have been demonstrated under professional and scientific conditions with consistent successful results. These successful demonstrations were witnessed and overseen by qualified third parties with scientific and engineering experience.</p>

        <P>However Experts who were not present at these demonstrations are generally sceptical.</P>
        <P>ALL demonstrations were always completed with supply batteries remaining charged.</P>
        <P>Trials were always completed with successful results.</P>
        <P>When applied to a motor vehicle this unit equates to an electric car that does not discharge in use.</P>
        <P>Due to people not accepting demonstrated results and to prove publicly this technology it is planned to to challenge the existing world electric vehicle records and complete the challenge with the batteries remaining <b>FULLY CHARGED</b>.
        Existing Records Guinness World Records for an electric vehicle on a single set of batteries are:
        <p><b><u>DISTANCE</u></b></p>
        <p>1013 Miles Held by Germany.</p>
        <p>(36 hrs 12 min)</p>      
        <p><b><u>ENDURANCE</u></b></p>
        <p>45 hrs 20 min Held by Japan.</p>
        <p>(840Miles)</p>

        <p>We plan to beat both these records and complete them with the vehicle batteries in a fully charged state. </p>
